# VSCode with MCP - Chatting with Your API

## TL;DR

In this article, youâ€™ll learn how to:

- Build a FastAPI Books API
- Expose it with MCP
- Chat with it in VS Code using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode
- Bonus: Extend into AI-powered interactions with Ollama + OpenWebUI

## Introduction

Why would you ever want to chat with your API in VS Code using MCP?

Because you can! ðŸ’ªðŸ˜‚

And honestly why not? The possibilities are endless.

This article walks you through setting up a simple REST API, publishing it with MCP, and using GitHub Copilot Chat in Agent Mode for interaction. And for those curious minds, thereâ€™s a bonus setup to push the boundaries even further.

## What is MCP, and Why Use It?

What is MCP? Itâ€™s like the USB-C of AI â€” standardizing how apps connect to LLMs. Though sadly, it doesn't charge your laptop... yet.

Want the nerdy details? [Dive into the official docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) â€” theyâ€™re surprisingly readable.

## Setting Up the Environment

Letâ€™s harness **uv**, the "Usain (V)Bolt of Python package managers", to set up your project. (Seriously, try install something. It's done before you finish typing).

1. **Initialize your project**:

   ```bash
   uv init
   ```

2. **Add dependencies**:

   ```bash
   uv add fastapi fastapi-mcp mcp pydantic requests uvicorn
   ```

3. **Configure your environment**:

   Create a `config.py` file:

   ```python
   WEB_API_PORT = 5000
   WEB_API_URL = f"http://localhost:{WEB_API_PORT}"
   ```

Optional: Your project tree might look like this:

```
ðŸ“‚ mcp-vscode-rest
â”œâ”€â”€ .vscode/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mcp.json
â”œâ”€â”€ books_server.py
â”œâ”€â”€ mcp_books_server.py
â””â”€â”€ config.py
```

Now your environment is ready to support the Books Management API and MCP integration!

## Building the Books Management API

Time to build a simple Books API using FastAPI.

1. **Endpoints**:

   - `/books` (POST): Add a new book.
   - `/books` (GET): Retrieve all books.
   - `/books/id/{book_id}` (GET): Get details of a specific book by ID.
   - `/books/id/{book_id}` (DELETE): Remove a book by ID.
   - `/books/search` (GET): Search for books by author, title, or category.

2. **Key Features**:

   - Validation with `pydantic` models (`Book`, `BookResponse`).
   - In-memory storage for simplicity (`library` dictionary).
   - Error handling using `HTTPException`.

Hereâ€™s an example of the `add_book` endpoint in the `books_server.py` file:

```python
@app.post("/books", response_model=Dict[str, str], operation_id="add_book")
async def add_book(book: Book = Body(...)):
    if not book.title.strip() or not book.author.strip():
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=400, detail="Title and author must be non-empty."
        )

    book_id = len(library) + 1
    library[book_id] = {
        "title": book.title.strip(),
        "author": book.author.strip(),
        "category": book.category.strip().lower() if book.category else None,
    }
    return {"message": f"Book added successfully with ID {book_id}"}
```

### Publishing Your FastAPI Endpoints with MCP

FastAPI-MCP is a **zero-configuration tool** for automatically exposing FastAPI endpoints as Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. With just a few lines of glue code, your FastAPI app gets MCP superpowers.

In `mcp_books_server.py`:

```python
import config
from fastapi_mcp import FastApiMCP
from books_server import app
import uvicorn

BASE_URL = config.WEB_API_URL

mcp = FastApiMCP(
    app,
    name="Books Server",
    description="A simple book management server",
    base_url=BASE_URL,
    describe_all_responses=True,
    describe_full_response_schema=True,
)

mcp.mount()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, port=5000)
```

Your API is now discoverable and describable via MCP. No extra boilerplate needed.

Check out the [FastAPI MCP GitHub repository](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp) for more details.

## Chatting with Your API in VS Code

Ready to talk to your API like itâ€™s ChatGPT? Letâ€™s go.

### 1. Configure MCP in VS Code

Create the `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your project folder to define the MCP server.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "mcp-books-server": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:5000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

This file tells VS Code where to find the MCP server and how to connect.

### 2. Start the MCP Server

```bash
uv run mcp_books_server.py
```

### 3. Use VS Code to Interact with MCP

Open the `.vscode/mcp.json` file and click the **Start** link above the server config. Voila! Youâ€™re live.

![mcp_json]

### 4. Test Your API

Try out scenarios like:

- **Adding Books**: _generate 3 books about programming and 2 about machine learning_.

  Do you see the beauty and potential of that?

  ![test_case_01]

- **Searching by Category**: _find the books in machine learning category_.

  This is awesome! (Of course not me in the profile picture below ðŸ¤“)

  ![test_case_02]

GitHub Copilot Chat will send real API calls and show you the responses inline. Itâ€™s like Postman with AI vibes.

## BONUS Setup: AI-Enhanced Flow

Want to go next level?

Try chaining: **FastAPI â†’ MCP â†’ Ollama â†’ OpenWebUI**

Now youâ€™re building **smart API agents** that can learn from feedback, log context, and evolve with your product. More on that in an upcoming lightning post! So stay tuned!

## Heads-Up: MCP's Awesomeness (with Quirks)

MCP is powerful â€” but sometimes it trips over its own genius. Ask it to juggle deletes and category filters and suddenly it's confused like when doing a rebase for the first time.

Stick with it, it's part of the future, and it's worth the ride. ðŸš€

## Your Turn

Try it out, have fun, and let me know how it works for you.
